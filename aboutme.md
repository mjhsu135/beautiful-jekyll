Hello! The name is Michelle Hsu (pronounced like the shoe that you wear) and I am a first year student at Arizona State University. 

Some of the coding languages and programs I know include:

- Excel
- Matlab
- R
- Python

### My story

I was born in California, moving from the Bay Area to further up north, closer to where the state capital Sacramento is located.
For undergrad, I went to California State University, Sacramento where I got a Bachelor of the Arts in Mathematics. It's here 
I learned more about formal proofs and introduced to Boolean logic. Intrigued, during my last semester I looked more into 
different coding languages such as Python and Matlab. I had a chance to use Jupyter Notebook as well before I graduated in May.
That is when I decided I wanted to pursue a masters related to coding and data analytics. Thus, I applied for the Program Evaluation 
and Data Analytics program at Arizona State University and got in!
